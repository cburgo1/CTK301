            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>This project has been one of the best projects that I have worked on in terms of learning new things, as I ran into MANY situations where I learned a new technique or method to model more efficiently.</p>

            <h3>Modeling the body</h3>
            <p>Modeling the body was not too difficult as I have already had practice with this, yet I did learn a different approach when modeling the body that I feel I enjoy much better. Working on the eyes and frontal face features first helped to get everything lined up later on in the process. With this NPR style of modeling, facial porportions are much more different than realistic styled character modeling and it is one of the major distinctions.</p>
            
            <h3>Rigging the body</h3>
            <p>Rigging the body was actually something quite new to me as I have tried it in the past, but never bothered to work on it more. I learned how bones and their potitions were crucial to remove headaches later on when weight painting. I now learned a more organized approach of layering my bones so that my body bones and clothing bones do not overlap one another and cause automatic weight paint to apply to both sets.</p>
            
            <h3>Modeling the clothing</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remclothing1.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remclothing2.png" alt="RemRender">
            <p>Modeling the clothes was also not too hard of a task as this is something that I was also comfortable with and have practiced in the past. I, however, learned that I could add a solidify modifier to make the clothing appear a little thicker and not like paper, which was a nice technique to learn and it came out very nice.</p>
            
            <h3>Rigging the clothing</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remclothingrig1.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remclothingrig2.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remclothingrig3.png" alt="RemRender">
            <p>Rigging the clothing was probably by far the hardest thing in this project as I ran into many problems of trying to seperately set weight to the skirt bones and not have it be influenced by the body bones, which i mentioned earlier was a thing that I learned during this project. I know of the importance of separating bones and giving them groups to toggle on and off and work on individually.</p>
            
            <h3>More detailed Rigging and Weight painting</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remdetailrig1.png" alt="RemRender">

            <h3>Line art</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remoutline1.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remoutline2.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remoutline3.png" alt="RemRender">
            <p>Line art is something I am still getting comfortable with as it has caused me trouble in the past with the line art applying around the eyes, which doesn't look right with the style im trying to follow. Through this project I learned that I can apply a vertex group to the face, weight paint everything except the eyes, and apply the solidify modifier to the vertex group I made which then leads to it solidifying everything except around the eyes.</p>
            
            <h3>Shaders</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remcolor.png" alt="RemRender">
            <img class="aboutimg" src="remoutline4.png" alt="RemRender">
            <p>Shaders is something new that I messed with in this project and I learned an easier way to do it where you surround your head with a 256 sided cylinder and then apply the data transfer vertex corners from the face to that cylinder, which gets the normals to look better and shading look nicer.</p>
            
            <h3>Shape keys</h3>
            <p>Shape keys was a new feature to mess with for me and I slowly learned how to make my model blink, wink, smile, do A E I O and U mouth shapes, and etc through the use of a separate vertex group for the shape keys.</p>
            
            <h3>Flail</h3>
            <p>The flail was more tedious than difficult in that I had to copy the chain links to a length that was long enough to wrap around my model.</p>
            
            <h3>Final render</h3>
            <img class="aboutimg" src="RemRender.png" alt="RemRender">
            <p>Here is the final model of Rem! It was a very informative journey and I learned plenty for when I create my next model. The render is in 4K and it was a simple as changing the output properties so that it came out in 4k instead of 1920 x 1080p, which doesnt show the model as good.</p>
