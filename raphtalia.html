            <p>This model is a 3d depiction of the character "Raphtalia" from the show "The rise of the shield hero." This was my first 3D model that I fully went through with, no matter the skill level that I was at. The goal was just to fully make a model even if the quality wasn't the best in the end. This was a very big achievement for me because even through all the frustration that I experienced during this project, I learned many things about modeling that I wouldn't have if I didn't just go for it.</p>
