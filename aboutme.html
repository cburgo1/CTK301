            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Christian Burgos and I am a 3D modeler who loves to create NPR (Non Photo Realistic) models. I generally create charcter models but plan to also extend to environments and more in the near future.</p>
            <p>My start to my 3D modelling journey began in the very beginning of 2023, where I began my first year into game design in Illinois State University. I have always loved games ever since childhood and it has been a thing that has shaped my life and my relationships. I have always been in love with the power of immersion and how one could escape into anew world with such ease and fulfill your dreams and fantasies. I gained this love through my experience with video games and anime and they impacted me in a strong way. My hope is that I can provide that to people and affect others the same way I was affected.</p>
